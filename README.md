# Eye movement project

## Description

Eye movement project is to creating a web page with two eyes that follow your mouse movement. This activity required to bring together skills in JavaScript and CSS to create this dynamic experience.This code originated from a code challenge in Week #8 of **MIT's MERN Coding Bootcamp**.

## How to Run:

Fork the repository into your computer and open it on you own code editor. You can change styles in the css file and you add more eyes on js file.

## Roadmap of future improvements:

I am planning to add smiling mouth. The smiling mouth will also work on mousemovement and when mouse move closer to close botton mouth will express sad emotion.
